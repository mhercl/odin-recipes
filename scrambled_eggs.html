    <h1>Scrambled Eggs!</h1>
<h2>Scrambled eggs to die for!!</h2>
<p>These eggs are amazing!! I modified Gordon Ramseys recepie to make what I would consider to be a superior plate of eggy goodness.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>A large knob of butter</li>
    <li>A pinch of MSG</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>A good pinch of Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Carfully crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork untill no curds remain. </li>
    <li>Add the MSG to the beaten eggs</li>
    <li>Put the butter in a non-stick saucepan and heat on full until the butter starts to brown.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs to the pan.</li>
    <li>leave the eggs for 20 seconds, I use this time to tidy up any mess I have made.</li>
    <li>After 20 seconds take the pan off the heat and using a plastic spatula, scrape the cooked eggs of the pan and scramble them!!</li>
    <li>Repeat the previous steps until your eggs are just about to your liking, they will cook for a bit after you take them off the heat.</li>
    <li>Serve on a plate and sprinkle the salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>ENJOY!!</li>
